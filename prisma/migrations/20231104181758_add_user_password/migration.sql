  Warnings:

  - You are about to drop the column `emailVerified` on the `User` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - Added the required column `password` to the `User` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
  - Made the column `email` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
